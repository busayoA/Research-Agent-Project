4. [22/02/2025] Somehow, in my refactoring, I broke the env but I've fixed it now


IN-PROGRESS
1. Test to see just how effective the multilingual support feature is


BACKLOG
1. Re-generating reports requires the cache to be cleared beforee it can work
2. The dropdown in the UI for selecting the models doesn't actually work just yet. 
I need to find why it is disconnected from the backend code
3. There are still multiple instances of repeated code in both the Agents and Utils modules
4. Keep 'em coming...
